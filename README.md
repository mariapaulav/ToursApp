🪄10th day of 100daysofcode !

Hello! Continuing with the challenge, I did a Tours app, it fetch the data from an API, and display  the available tours in it,
You can delete the tours if you are no interested on it, an also if you want more info, you can press the “Read more” button, an then the “show less” button

This app was created with css html javascript react.
